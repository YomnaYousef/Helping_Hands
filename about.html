        <b>Helping Hands is platform that connects donors with people or organizations in need.
         We provide a convenient and efficient way for people to donate their unused or unwanted 
        items to those who could benefit from them. <br>
        This can include food, clothing, household goods, and other items that are in good condition
         but no longer needed by the donor. The website can provide a platform  for donors to list the  items they want to donate,  and for recipients to browse and request the items they need.</b>
